# Contributing Guide (Agent Playbook)

This guide is a **drop-in template** for any GitHub repository. It defines how an autonomous coding agent (and its subagents) must plan, branch, commit, review, and merge work. It is written in imperative voice: every "MUST" / "MUST NOT" is a hard rule.

The agent's north star: **ship small, reviewable, reversible slices; keep it simple and decide the obvious yourself, escalating only genuine forks; never touch `main` without explicit approval.**

## 1. Core Principles

- **Keep it simple and linear.** Build the smallest thing that satisfies the spec. Do not add scope, abstraction, features, or ceremony the task did not ask for. Do not make the project more than it is. When two paths both work, take the simpler one. When in doubt, do less.
- **Use senior-developer discretion.** Act like a talented senior engineer: make straightforward, reasonable fixes and decisions yourself instead of asking permission for the obvious. Don't make silly mistakes, and know where the boundaries are (§11). The bar for interrupting the human is high — see [§11.1](#111-when-to-decide-vs-ask).
- **Plan, then read your plan, then execute.** Never begin editing code before a written spec exists and has been re-read.
- **One small feature per branch.** A branch holds a few commits at most, each tightly scoped to one condensed piece of behavior.
- **Distribute and parallelize** work across a tree of branches using subagents. The tree always terminates at a single **root branch** that is the only branch that merges to `main`.
- **The agent does not make *genuine-fork* calls alone.** Product/UX, public API shape, naming, dependencies, architecture, security posture — the categories in [§11](#11-subjective-vs-objective-decisions) — are escalated. Straightforward, obviously-right fixes are made at the agent's discretion, not escalated (see [§11.1](#111-when-to-decide-vs-ask)).
- **The internal review agent is triaged each round, not chased to zero.** Wait for the review subagent's pass ([§7](#7-phase-5--review-agent)), decide at the Opus tier which of its findings actually warrant a change (§11.1), make only those, and re-review if warranted. More than one review-fix round is normal — but each round must be earning its keep. Stop once a round's findings stop being substantive (§7); do not keep looping in pursuit of a perfectly silent report.
- **`main` is sacred.** No direct pushes, no force pushes, no auto-merge, no shortcuts.

---

## 2. Model Assignment (Mandatory)

This project's agent runs as a fleet of subagents, and **each subagent's model is dictated by the
kind of work it does — never by whatever model the parent chat session happens to be running.**
If you are the parent/orchestrating agent, you are very likely running as a different model than
the one required below for a given piece of work. That does not exempt you: when you spawn a
subagent to do that work, you MUST explicitly pin its model to the assignment below. This rule is
not a default or a suggestion — it is a hard requirement, checked on every subagent spawn.

| Kind of work | Required tier | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Writing/editing code** (implementing a slice, fixing a bug, writing tests) | **Sonnet** (`model: "sonnet"`) | All "coding" subagents from [§5](#5-phase-3--executing-slices-subagents). |
| **Thinking and planning** — writing/updating the plan in `memory/`, deciding branch/slice breakdown, triaging review findings ([§7](#7-phase-5--review-agent)), deciding whether a proposed doc/fix change should be made at all | **Opus** (`model: "opus"`) | This is the "judgment" layer — anywhere the agent is deciding *what* to do or *whether* something is worth doing, not executing an already-decided mechanical step. |
| **Documentation and simple mechanical fixes** — writing/updating docs, README content, changelog entries, and applying already-decided, already-verified simple fixes after a PR has passed review | **Haiku** (`model: "haiku"`) | Only for execution of a change that Opus has already decided should happen (see above). Haiku does not decide anything — it writes what it's told to write. |
| **The review agent itself** ([§7](#7-phase-5--review-agent)) | **Opus** (`model: "opus"`) | An elite adversarial review is a judgment task (finding defects, weighing severity), not a code-writing task — it uses the thinking-tier model, not the coding-tier model. |

`model: "..."` above is the tier label passed at the actual subagent-spawn call
site (e.g. the `Agent`/`Task` tool's `model` parameter) — it always resolves to
whatever concrete model currently backs that tier, so this table never needs
updating when a tier's underlying model version changes. For code that needs a
concrete model ID directly, `runner/spec.py`'s `MODELS` dict is the single
authoritative source — it is documented in-file as "the one place to bump an
id"; do not hardcode a model ID anywhere else, including in this document.
(`GTSKILL_JUDGE_MODEL` is a deliberate runtime override that *bypasses*
`runner/spec.py`'s default, not an example of it — see `runner/judge.py`'s own
comments on why that override exists.) This document previously named specific
concrete IDs here and drifted out of sync with `runner/spec.py`'s actual
pins — a related but distinct failure mode from the one `runner/judge.py`'s
comments record (a model *capability* mismatch, not a doc-vs-pin drift).
Tier labels don't have either failure mode.

Rules for applying this table:

- **Pin the model tier explicitly on every spawn.** Never rely on inheritance from the parent session.
- **Never downgrade a thinking/review task to save cost.** Planning, triage, and review stay on the
  Opus tier — do not fall back to Sonnet or Haiku for these regardless of which concrete Opus
  version is currently available.
- **Never upgrade a mechanical task "just in case."** Docs and already-decided simple fixes stay on
  Haiku; if a "simple fix" turns out to need judgment once a subagent is in it, that subagent
  escalates back to the parent rather than silently deciding on its own tier.
- **Parallelize aggressively, serialize only real dependencies.** Independent coding slices spawn
  as multiple concurrent Sonnet-tier subagents in one batch. A slice that depends on another's output
  waits for it — do not parallelize dependent work just because subagents are cheap to spawn. This
  applies at every layer: independent sub-branches within a feature, independent feature branches
  within the root, and independent review/fix cycles across sibling PRs.

---

## 3. Phase 1 — Plan Before You Touch Code

For every task, spec, or feature request:

1. Create a working plan file at:
   ```
   memory/<spec-name>.md
   ```
   The `memory/` directory MUST be listed in `.gitignore`. This is the agent's private working
   memory for this project — planning notes, specs, and progress state — not artifacts of the PR.
   (Some in-flight and historical plans in this specific repo predate this convention and live in
   `.planning/` instead — also gitignored, not being migrated by this rewrite. New plans go in
   `memory/`; don't assume a `memory/<spec-name>.md` path resolves for older work.)

2. The plan file MUST include:
   - **Goal** — one paragraph.
   - **Scope in / Scope out** — bulleted.
   - **Assumptions** — anything the agent inferred.
   - **Subjective items to escalate** — list every decision the agent identifies as opinion-shaped (see [§11](#11-subjective-vs-objective-decisions)). Ask the human before proceeding on any of these.
   - **Slice breakdown** — the ordered list of small features, each destined for its own branch.
   - **Branch tree sketch** — root branch, feature branches, sub-branches, and their parent relationships.
   - **Acceptance criteria** — per slice, measurable and testable.
   - **Risks / rollback notes**.

3. **Re-read the plan** in a fresh step before executing. This is not optional — the read pass is what catches contradictions the write pass missed.

4. If the plan changes mid-flight, update `memory/<spec-name>.md` first, then continue.

---

## 4. Phase 2 — The Branch Tree

Work is organized as a **worktree**: many small branches that all trace back to one root branch, which is the only branch permitted to open a PR into `main`.

```
main
 └── root branch          (integration branch for the whole spec)
      ├── feature branch A
      │    ├── sub-branch A1
      │    └── sub-branch A2
      ├── feature branch B
      │    └── sub-branch B1
      └── feature branch C
```

### Rules for the tree

- **Naming:** follow the repo's existing branch conventions. Inspect recent branches (`git branch -a`, PR history, any `CONTRIBUTING`/`STYLE` docs) and mirror the shape. If no convention exists, propose one to the user and get approval before creating branches.
- **Root branch:** created off the latest `main`. It is long-lived for the duration of the spec and only receives merges from its feature children.
- **Feature branches:** branch off the root. Each represents one cohesive capability from the plan.
- **Sub-branches:** branch off a feature. Each holds **one atomic slice** — the smallest shippable unit of that feature.
- **Commits per branch:** keep it to a handful of small, semantically meaningful commits. If a branch grows large, split it into more sub-branches.
- **Parallelism:** independent slices MUST be developed in parallel via subagents (see [§5](#5-phase-3--executing-slices-subagents)). Dependent slices are serialized behind their parent.
- **Isolation:** a single repository checkout can only have one branch checked out at a time — if two subagents share it, one switching branches yanks the working tree out from under the other, and edits or commits can land on the wrong branch. Each subagent working an in-flight branch in parallel with another MUST get its own git worktree (or clone). If isolated worktrees genuinely aren't available, serialize the branch work instead of sharing one checkout.
- **Every branch is a leaf until proven otherwise.** Only create children when needed.

---

## 5. Phase 3 — Executing Slices (Subagents)

The agent MUST delegate slice work to subagents to parallelize and to keep each unit of work optimally scoped.

### When to spawn a subagent

- The slice is independent of other in-flight slices.
- The slice has clear, written acceptance criteria in the plan.
- The slice can be completed without needing to negotiate scope with the user mid-execution.

### Subagent context contract

Each subagent invocation MUST include a **context contract** in its prompt:

1. **Targeted goal** — a single-sentence objective for the slice.
2. **Branch to work on** — exact branch name, and the parent it was cut from.
3. **Files/areas expected to change** — the agent's best guess; the subagent may expand this after investigating.
4. **Detailed acceptance criteria** — how "done" is measured (tests to pass, behaviors to demonstrate, files to produce).
5. **Non-goals** — what the subagent MUST NOT touch or refactor.
6. **Escalation triggers** — the categories from [§11](#11-subjective-vs-objective-decisions) that, if encountered, must be surfaced to the parent agent (which surfaces to the human) rather than decided unilaterally.

The subagent **may read the entire repository** as needed to understand context, but its **writes must be surgical** and confined to what the acceptance criteria require. Broad reads, narrow writes.

### Subagent completion

A subagent's final message back to the parent MUST include:
- Files changed and why.
- Any assumptions it made.
- Any items it flagged as subjective and did **not** decide.
- Test/lint results.
- The PR URL (see [§6](#6-phase-4--pull-requests)).

---

## 6. Phase 4 — Pull Requests

Every branch (sub → feature, feature → root) is integrated via a PR. No exceptions.

### PR requirements

- **Base branch:** the direct parent in the tree. Sub-branch PRs target their feature branch. Feature PRs target the root branch. Only the root branch PR targets `main`.
- **Title:** concise, imperative, scoped to the slice.
- **Description MUST contain:**
  - The relevant excerpt from the parent plan section in `memory/<spec-name>.md`, pasted directly into the description — `memory/` is gitignored, so a link to it would 404 for reviewers; the pasted excerpt is the only thing that actually resolves.
  - Summary of behavior change.
  - Explicit list of what was **not** changed / left for later slices.
  - Test evidence (commands run, output summary).
  - Any items the agent flagged as subjective and is awaiting human input on.
- **Size:** small. If a PR's diff is sprawling, split it into more sub-branches.
- **Draft first** if the agent is still iterating; mark ready for review only when it believes the slice is complete.
- **Request the review agent immediately.** As soon as the PR is opened (or marked ready), spawn the review subagent. See [§7](#7-phase-5--review-agent) for the full context-contract and triage protocol.

---

## 7. Phase 5 — Review Agent

There is no external Codex/ChatGPT review available to this project (Codex review credits are
exhausted). The agent MUST NOT wait for, poll for, or otherwise depend on an external
`chatgpt-codex-connector[bot]` review — none is coming. Instead, the orchestrating agent runs its
**own internal review subagent** for every PR, and that self-hosted review is the mandatory gate
before any PR merges up the tree. Default to this self-review even if an external trigger appears
available in `.github/workflows/` (e.g. a `claude.yml` responding to `@claude` mentions) — an
`@claude`-mention reply is not the adversarial, diff-scoped review this section requires, and
treating it as a substitute would silently skip the gate. More than one review-fix round is
normal and expected for a PR with real findings — but the loop still has a **stopping condition**
(see "When to stop reviewing" below): it isn't "re-review forever until there is literally
nothing left to say."

### The review agent's context contract — PR only, nothing more

This is the load-bearing rule of this section. The review subagent MUST be spawned with:

- the PR's **full diff** (every changed file, not just hunks),
- the PR **title and description**,
- and **nothing else** from the surrounding task.

"Nothing else" bounds *sources of context*, not *tools*: the review subagent MAY read any
changed file's full current content directly from the repo (a raw diff hunk's few lines of
surrounding context are often not enough to judge correctness) and MAY run read-only commands
(tests, greps, a self-comparison) to verify a claim. It MUST NOT be given, and must not go
looking for: the parent session's conversation history, the working plan (`memory/` for new plans,
`.planning/` for this repo's pre-existing ones — see [§3](#3-phase-1--plan-before-you-touch-code)),
the implementer's rationale for why it made the choices it made, or prior review rounds' comments
on this same PR. This is deliberate, not an oversight — a reviewer that only sees the diff, the
PR's own stated intent, and the repo's own current state reviews what the code actually does, not
what the implementer intended it to do, and cannot be talked out of a finding by context the code
itself doesn't carry. If a later round is needed after fixes, spawn a **fresh** review subagent
with the same restricted contract against the new diff — do not reuse or carry forward the prior
round's subagent state, and do not pass it prior rounds' comments (see the "note why in the PR
description" rule in the triage section below for how a declined finding is meant to stay
suppressed across rounds instead).

### Model and goal

Per [§2](#2-model-assignment-mandatory), the review subagent runs on the **Opus tier**
(`model: "opus"`) — review is a judgment task, not a code-writing task, so it uses the
thinking-tier model regardless of what tier wrote the code under review.

Brief the review subagent to be an **elite, adversarial reviewer**, not a friendly pass. Its job
is to find every way the diff is wrong, unsafe, or wasteful — not to summarize what it does. At
minimum it must actively hunt for:

- **Correctness bugs** — logic errors, off-by-one errors, incorrect edge-case handling, wrong
  operator/boundary, race conditions, incorrect assumptions about inputs, silently swallowed
  exceptions.
- **Security issues** — injection (SQL/shell/path), unsafe deserialization, secrets or credentials
  handling, SSRF, unsafe use of `eval`/`exec`/pickle, missing input validation at trust boundaries.
- **Inefficiencies** — quadratic-or-worse algorithms where linear is available, redundant
  recomputation, unnecessary I/O or subprocess spawns in a loop, re-rendering a table/re-running
  the judge when a cheaper deterministic check would answer the same question.
- **Poorly managed data / eval integrity** — a corpus ground truth or checked-in golden PNG mutated
  without regenerating what depends on it, a comparator or judge scoring change silently applied
  to some but not all of `eval-results/**` (candidate-set vs. scoring-method confounds — this repo
  has hit this exact bug before), non-reproducible eval runs (missing seeds, a judge call made
  without pinning the model/temperature contract), skill-file content (`.claude/skills/**`) that
  drifts from what `runner/comparator.py`'s checks or `runner/spec.py`'s model pins actually
  enforce, silent `NaN`/null handling in a check that changes its score.
- **Missing or weak tests** for the behavior the PR claims to add.

Findings must be reported **ordered most-severe-first**, each with a concrete failure
scenario (specific input/state → specific wrong output or crash) — not vague style commentary.
End with a short verdict on whether the PR is safe to merge up as-is.

### When the review agent runs

- **On every PR open (or draft → ready transition)** — spawn the review subagent against the
  initial diff before any merge-up consideration.
- **After every subsequent push** — a prior round's review is stale the moment new commits land;
  spawn a fresh review subagent against the new diff.
- **Wait for CI too.** Before triaging a round of findings, also wait for the **entire CI run**
  (every job configured for this repo, not just the fastest one) to finish. Collect all CI
  failures and all review findings together, then address them in one follow-up pass — do not
  react to a partial signal from either source. If a repo has no test/CI workflow beyond a
  trigger-only action (e.g. an `@claude`-mention responder with no automated test job), this gate
  is trivially satisfied — there is nothing else to wait for.
- **If the review subagent itself fails** (errors, times out, or returns no usable report): retry
  once with a fresh spawn against the same diff. If it fails again, do not treat that as "review
  passed" or merge around it — either perform the adversarial review yourself at the Opus tier
  using the same context contract (diff + description only) and note in the PR that this round was
  self-reviewed and why, or escalate to the human if you cannot do the review yourself with
  confidence. A PR never merges up on the theory that the gate "would have passed."
- **A background review subagent's completion is a claim, not a fact until directly confirmed.**
  If the review is running in the background (the default for subagents), do not assert "still
  waiting" or "review passed" from memory of when it was spawned — a completion notification can
  arrive during a gap in the conversation and go unprocessed. Check its actual current status
  directly before triaging or before telling anyone the PR is ready.

### Triage the findings — this is an Opus decision

Reading the review subagent's report and deciding what to do about each finding is **thinking
work**: per [§2](#2-model-assignment-mandatory), this triage happens at the Opus tier, never
delegated to the Sonnet coding subagent and never done by skimming. For each finding, apply the
[§11.1](#111-when-to-decide-vs-ask) test:

1. **If the fix is clear and reasonable — decide to make it**, then hand the specific, scoped fix
   to a Sonnet-tier coding subagent (or, if it is genuinely just prose/doc/no-judgment-required, a
   Haiku subagent per [§2](#2-model-assignment-mandatory)). A defect, an inconsistency, a missed
   test, a straightforward correctness/security/data-integrity fix is the agent's to decide and
   delegate at its own discretion.
2. **Escalate only a genuine fork:** a fix with **multiple materially-different reasonable
   implementations**, or a true product/policy/naming/architecture/security-posture decision per
   [§11](#11-subjective-vs-objective-decisions). Ask one focused question — "implement it this way
   or that way?" — with a recommendation. Do not ask about fixes that are straightforward.
3. **Decline what would overcomplicate.** A suggestion adding scope/abstraction/infrastructure
   beyond what the spec needs may be declined or deferred — note why **in the PR description**
   (not just a comment). This matters mechanically, not just for the human record: the next
   round's review subagent is spawned fresh with only the diff and the PR's title/description
   (see the context contract above) — it never sees prior comments, so a declined item only stays
   suppressed if the reasoning lives in the description itself. Simplicity (§1) outranks satisfying
   every finding.
4. **Push a follow-up commit with the decided fixes and spawn a fresh review subagent** against
   the new diff. If that round surfaces more substantive findings, repeat the same Opus-tier
   triage. If it doesn't (see below), stop.

### When to stop reviewing

The goal is never a literally empty report — it's a round whose findings stop being worth acting
on. After each round, ask (at the Opus tier) whether it raised anything substantive: a real
defect, a security issue, a data-integrity problem, a genuine fork. If yes, fix or escalate it and
go again. Stop the loop once a round's remaining findings are:

- restating something already declined or deferred with a reason on the PR,
- purely stylistic/cosmetic with no behavior, security, or data-integrity impact,
- scope the PR deliberately doesn't cover, or
- otherwise not clearing the [§11.1](#111-when-to-decide-vs-ask) bar for "worth changing."

Note the outcome briefly on the PR ("remaining findings are stylistic nits / already addressed —
stopping here") and move on. This is an Opus-tier judgment call the agent makes itself, not a
genuine fork to escalate to the human.

**Repeated out-of-scope findings cap the loop at 2–3 rounds.** Each fresh review subagent sees
only the diff and the PR description (not prior rounds' comments), so a declined item can only
stop recurring if its rationale was added to the description per the triage step above. If a
round's findings are out-of-scope and the next fresh-diff round comes back with the same or other
out-of-scope content anyway *despite* the description already covering it, that is evidence the
loop has stopped being productive, not a reason to keep spawning review subagents hoping for a
cleaner pass. Note this on the PR ("review agent kept raising out-of-scope items already declined
in the description — stopping after round N") and move on.

The PR is eligible to merge up once **both** are true: the review has reached its stopping point
per the criteria above, and any escalated forks are resolved by the human. None of this requires a
spotless report — it requires that every round's findings were actually triaged at the Opus tier
and acted on where it mattered.

### Posting the review for auditability

Post the review subagent's findings (or a summary of them, for a long report) as a PR comment,
clearly labelled as the internal review agent's pass and the model tier it ran on, so the record
of what was reviewed and decided is visible on the PR itself rather than only in the agent's own
working memory.

---

## 8. Phase 6 — Merging Up the Tree

- Merges from sub → feature and feature → root are **allowed and expected** without additional user gating, provided **CI is green (all jobs)** and the review agent pass in [§7](#7-phase-5--review-agent) has been triaged.
- **Use merge commits everywhere** (not squash, not rebase-and-merge). Full history is preserved so the small-commit trail up the tree stays intact and auditable.
- After each successful merge, propose branch cleanup per [§10](#10-phase-8--branch-cleanup).

---

## 9. Phase 7 — Merging to `main`

The root-branch → `main` merge is the **only** merge that requires the human user's explicit, complete review and acceptance.

Before proposing the merge to `main`, the agent MUST:
- Confirm every feature PR has merged into the root branch.
- Confirm CI is green on the root branch.
- Post a consolidated summary to the human: goal, slice list, notable decisions, subjective items resolved, test coverage, migration/rollback notes.
- **Wait for the human's explicit approval** to merge to `main`.

Auto-merge MUST NOT be enabled on any PR targeting `main`. Merge only happens after the human says "merge it."

---

## 10. Phase 8 — Branch Cleanup

**Merged branches MUST be removed once they are no longer relevant.** Stale branches clutter the tree and confuse future work.

- After a sub-branch is merged into its feature, the sub-branch is a candidate for deletion.
- After a feature branch is merged into the root, the feature branch is a candidate for deletion.
- After the root branch is merged into `main`, the root branch is a candidate for deletion.

Rules:
- The agent MUST propose the deletion to the user (list of branches, local + remote) and **wait for approval** before deleting. Branch deletion is one of the actions that requires explicit user consent.
- Never delete a branch that still has open PRs, unmerged commits, or ongoing work by any collaborator.
- Delete both the local and the remote branch once approved.

---

## 11. Subjective vs. Objective Decisions

The agent's job is to **think about what is important** and, for every change under consideration, ask: *"Is any part of this dependent on human opinion, product judgment, or repo-level policy?"* If yes — and it is a genuine fork — it escalates. Otherwise it decides and moves on.

### 11.1 When to decide vs. ask

Default to **deciding**. Interrupt the human only when it is genuinely warranted. Before asking, run this test:

- **Is the fix/decision straightforward with one obviously-right answer?** → **Decide and do it.** (correctness fixes, inconsistencies, mechanical refactors, tests, security/robustness fixes, following an explicit instruction, the plainly-simpler of two options.)
- **Are there multiple materially-different reasonable implementations?** → **Ask** one focused "this way or that way?" question with a recommendation. A difference that is trivial or cosmetic is *not* material — pick the clean one and move on.
- **Is it one of the always-subjective categories below (product/UX, public API shape, naming, deps, architecture, security posture)?** → **Ask.**
- **Would it add scope/abstraction/infra the spec doesn't need?** → **Don't do it** (or do the minimal version); note the choice.

Batch genuinely-needed questions; never fan a single review out into many small questions. When you do proceed on your own, say briefly what you decided and why, so it stays auditable.

### Always subjective — escalate to the human

- **Product/UX behavior and copy** — what the feature does from a user's perspective, wording, tone.
- **API shape / public interface design** — endpoints, payload shapes, function signatures exposed to consumers.
- **Naming** — files, symbols, endpoints, config keys. Naming carries meaning; the human owns it.
- **Dependency additions or version bumps** — adding a package, upgrading a major version, swapping a library.
- **Architectural tradeoffs** — performance vs. readability, sync vs. async, monolith vs. split, caching strategy.
- **Security posture decisions** — auth models, threat scope, what data is trusted, what is logged.
- **Deleting or renaming existing public APIs** — anything that could break downstream consumers.
- **Anything else the agent's judgment flags as opinion-shaped.** When in doubt, ask.

### Safe to decide autonomously

- Mechanical refactors that preserve behavior.
- Fixing a demonstrated bug with a minimal change.
- Adding tests for existing behavior.
- Following an explicit instruction the human already gave.
- Complying with lint/format rules already configured in the repo.

### How to escalate

- Present the decision, the options, the tradeoffs, and a recommendation.
- Do not proceed with the affected code path until the human answers.
- Record the answer in the PR description so the decision is auditable.

---

## 12. Hard Prohibitions

The agent MUST NOT:

- Push directly to `main`.
- Force push to any branch (`--force`, `--force-with-lease`, or otherwise) without explicit human instruction for that specific push.
- Bypass hooks (`--no-verify`) for any reason.
- Amend or rewrite commits that have already been pushed.
- Enable auto-merge on any PR targeting `main`.
- Delete any branch without user approval.
- Commit secrets, tokens, credentials, or `.env` files. If one is discovered committed, stop and alert the user.
- Make a genuine-fork decision on the human's behalf — a §11 category (product/UX, public API shape, naming, deps, architecture, security posture) or a choice with multiple materially-different reasonable implementations (see [§11.1](#111-when-to-decide-vs-ask)). Straightforward fixes are the agent's to make.
- Merge a PR up the tree before the review agent's pass ([§7](#7-phase-5--review-agent)) has been read and triaged (at the Opus tier) for the latest diff.
- Treat "the CI passed" as a substitute for the review agent's pass.
- Spawn any subagent without pinning its model per [§2](#2-model-assignment-mandatory) — including spawning the review agent on anything other than the Opus tier, or having the review agent's context include anything beyond the PR diff and description as bounded in [§7](#7-phase-5--review-agent) (sources, not tools).

Per slice:
- [ ] Cut a sub-branch off the correct feature branch.
- [ ] Spawned a subagent with a full context contract (goal, branch, files, acceptance, non-goals, escalation triggers).
- [ ] Made a small number of tightly scoped commits.
- [ ] Opened a PR to the parent branch with a complete description.

Per PR:
- [ ] Spawned the review subagent as part of opening the PR — on the Opus tier, context-limited to the PR diff + description only per [§7](#7-phase-5--review-agent)'s context contract (sources, not tools).
- [ ] Waited for the **entire CI run** (completed, green or red) AND the **fresh review subagent pass** against the latest diff to finish before making any fix — no reacting to partial signals.
- [ ] Triaged the review subagent's findings at the Opus tier per [§11.1](#111-when-to-decide-vs-ask); delegated decided fixes to the Sonnet tier (or Haiku for pure docs/no-judgment fixes).
- [ ] Posted the review subagent's findings (or a summary) as a PR comment, labelled as the internal review agent's pass.
- [ ] Made the reasonable fixes at own discretion each round; declined/deferred anything that would overcomplicate (noted why).
- [ ] Escalated only genuine forks (multiple reasonable implementations, or a §11 decision); recorded the human's answer.
- [ ] Repeated review-fix rounds only while findings stayed substantive; stopped once remaining comments were nits/already-addressed/out-of-scope, and noted that on the PR.
- [ ] Merged up with a **merge commit** (not squash, not rebase).
- [ ] Proposed branch deletion to the human.

For `main`:
- [ ] All features merged into root; CI green.
- [ ] Posted consolidated summary to the human.
- [ ] Received **explicit** approval.
- [ ] Merged via merge commit. No force push. No auto-merge.
- [ ] Proposed root-branch deletion.
